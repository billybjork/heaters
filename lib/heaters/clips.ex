defmodule Heaters.Clips do
  @moduledoc """
  Main context for enhanced virtual clip operations and workflow management.

  This module serves as the primary entry point for all clip-related operations,
  providing a clean public API while delegating to specialized sub-modules.

  ## Sub-contexts

  - **Review**: Virtual clip review workflow with cut point operations (`Heaters.Clips.Review`)
  - **VirtualClips**: Enhanced virtual clip processing operations (`Heaters.Clips.VirtualClips`)
  - **Artifacts**: Keyframe extraction and clip artifact management (`Heaters.Clips.Artifacts`)
  - **Export**: Virtual clip export to physical files (`Heaters.Clips.Export`)
  - **Archive**: Clip archival operations (`Heaters.Clips.Archive`)
  - **Embeddings**: Embedding generation and queries (`Heaters.Clips.Embeddings`)

  ## Schema

  - **Clip**: The main clip schema with virtual/physical support (`Heaters.Clips.Clip`)

  ## Examples

      # Review operations (cut point management)
      Clips.next_pending_review_clips(10)
      Clips.select_clip_and_fetch_next(clip, "approve")

      # Virtual clip operations
      VirtualClips.add_cut_point(source_video_id, frame_num, user_id)
      VirtualClips.remove_cut_point(source_video_id, frame_num, user_id)

      # Export operations (virtual â†’ physical)
      Export.Worker.handle_work(%{clip_id: clip_id})

      # Embedding operations (on exported clips)
      Clips.start_embedding(clip_id)
      Clips.similar_clips(main_clip_id, filters, asc?, page, per)
  """

  # Delegated functions for common operations
  alias Heaters.Clips.{Review, Operations, Embeddings, Queries}

  ## Review delegation

  @doc """
  Fetch clips awaiting review.

      # Get next 10 clips for review
      clips = Clips.next_pending_review_clips(10)

      # Get next 5 clips, excluding some IDs
      clips = Clips.next_pending_review_clips(5, [123, 456])
