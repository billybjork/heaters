# Enhanced Virtual Clips Architecture

## Overview

**Goal**: Complete the transition to a pure virtual clip workflow with enhanced cut point management, MECE validation, and rolling export. Eliminate all legacy merge/split/splice/sprite concepts for a clean, maintainable architecture.

### Current Progress Summary

This document tracks the comprehensive refactor of the video processing system's clip management architecture. The system now processes scraped internet videos, splits them into clips using CV-based scene detection, and enables human review for final curationâ€”all using a pure virtual clip workflow.

**Original Challenge**: The legacy system encoded clips during scene detection, making review operations expensive due to re-encoding. Sprite generation for navigation added complexity and storage overhead.

**Solution Approach**: Transition to "virtual clips"â€”database records with cut points, no physical files until final export. This enables instant review operations, eliminates intermediate file generation, and provides a clean, maintainable foundation.

**Major Work Completed:**
- âœ… **Legacy Code Removal**: All legacy merge/split/splice/sprite code and files fully removed. See "Legacy Code Removal Plan (Historical)" below.
- âœ… **Enhanced VirtualClips Module**: Refactored into focused modules:
  - `virtual_clips/` (core creation/management)
  - `virtual_clips/cut_point_operations.ex` (add/remove/move cut point operations)
  - `virtual_clips/mece_validation.ex` (MECE validation)
  - `virtual_clips/cut_point_operation.ex` (audit trail schema)
- âœ… **Artifacts/Shared Organization**: Artifact utilities moved to `artifacts/operations.ex`. Shared error handling in `shared/error_handling.ex`.
- âœ… **Centralized FFmpeg Configuration**: Declarative encoding profiles eliminating hardcoded settings across Python/Elixir with consistent `master`, `proxy`, and optimized export strategy.
- âœ… **Organizational Cleanup**: Directory structure flattened, all module references updated, deprecated code (~85 lines) removed.
- ðŸ”„ **Current State**: Clean, maintainable foundation ready for Phase 2 (Rolling Export System).

**Architecture Foundation**: All cut point operations now maintain MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) properties through algorithmic validation, ensuring no gaps, overlaps, or coverage holes in video processing.

## Key Principles

1. **Virtual-First**: All clips start as virtual cut points, only materialized when exported
2. **MECE Guarantee**: Cut points across source videos are mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive  
3. **Rolling Export**: Individual clip export rather than batch processing
4. **Clean Abstractions**: No legacy merge/split/splice/sprite concepts, centralized FFmpeg configuration
5. **WebCodecs Native**: Frame-perfect seeking without sprite dependencies

## Core Architecture

### Virtual Clip Lifecycle

```
Source Video: new â†’ download â†’ preprocess â†’ detect_scenes â†’ virtual clips created
                                    â†“
Virtual Clips: pending_review â†’ review_approved â†’ exported (physical) â†’ keyframed â†’ embedded
                    â†“                â†“                â†“
              review_skipped    cut_adjustments   keyframe_failed
                    â†“           (instant DB ops)        â†“
             (terminal)              â†“          (resumable)
                              pending_review
```

### Module Structure (Post-Refactor)

- **`virtual_clips/`**: Virtual clip management
  - `virtual_clips.ex`: Core creation and management
  - `cut_point_operations.ex`: Add/remove/move cut point operations (instant DB transactions)
  - `mece_validation.ex`: MECE validation and coverage checking
  - `cut_point_operation.ex`: Audit trail schema for cut point history
- **`artifacts/`**: Pipeline stages for supplementary data
  - `operations.ex`: Artifact utilities and S3 path management
  - `keyframe/`: Keyframe extraction modules
- **`shared/`**: Cross-context utilities
  - `error_handling.ex`: Centralized error handling and failure tracking
- **`export/`**: Final clip creation from proxy using stream copy for optimal quality/performance
  - `worker.ex`: Batch/rolling export operations

---

**Frontend (assets/js/): Modular WebCodecs Player**
  - `webcodecs-player-core.js`: Main WebCodecs player implementation (virtual clips, frame-perfect seeking)
  - `fallback-video-player.js`: Fallback player for browsers without WebCodecs or for non-virtual clips
  - `webcodecs-player-controller.js`: Phoenix LiveView hook/controller for player initialization and event wiring
  - `webcodecs-player.js`: Re-export for backward compatibility

### Cut Point Management

All cut point operations are now instant database transactions with full audit trail and MECE validation:
- **Add Cut Point**: Split virtual clip at frame â†’ two new virtual clips, archive original
- **Remove Cut Point**: Merge adjacent virtual clips â†’ new virtual clip, archive originals  
- **Move Cut Point**: Adjust boundaries of adjacent virtual clips
- **MECE Validation**: Ensure no gaps, overlaps, or coverage holes

## Enhanced Virtual Clips Operations

### Core Functions

```elixir
# Enhanced VirtualClips module (delegates to focused modules)
defmodule Heaters.Clips.VirtualClips do
  def create_virtual_clips_from_cut_points/3
  def update_virtual_clip_cut_points/2
  defdelegate add_cut_point(source_video_id, frame_number, user_id), to: CutPointOperations
  defdelegate remove_cut_point(source_video_id, frame_number, user_id), to: CutPointOperations
  defdelegate move_cut_point(source_video_id, old_frame, new_frame, user_id), to: CutPointOperations
  defdelegate validate_mece_for_source_video(source_video_id), to: MeceValidation
  defdelegate get_cut_points_for_source_video(source_video_id), to: MeceValidation
  defdelegate ensure_complete_coverage(source_video_id, total_duration), to: MeceValidation
end
```

## Review Workflow (Post-Legacy)

1. **Human reviews virtual clips and takes actions:**
   - **approve** â†’ `review_approved` (ready for export)
   - **skip** â†’ `review_skipped` (terminal state)
   - **archive** â†’ `review_archived` (cleanup via archive worker)
   - **group** â†’ group clips for review/metadata purposes
   - **add/remove/move cut point** â†’ instant cut point operations via `VirtualClips.CutPointOperations` â†’ new virtual clips with full audit trail
2. **Actions execute immediately with database transactions, no file re-encoding**
3. **Undo:** Only a simple UI-level undo (e.g., Control+Z) for the most recent action is supported. No buffer/Oban undo or multi-step undo remains.
