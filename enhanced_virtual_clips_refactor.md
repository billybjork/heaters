# Enhanced Virtual Clips Architecture

## Overview

**Goal**: Complete the transition to a pure virtual clip workflow with enhanced cut point management, MECE validation, and rolling export. Eliminate all legacy merge/split/splice/sprite concepts for a clean, maintainable architecture.

### Current Progress Summary

This document tracks the comprehensive refactor of the video processing system's clip management architecture. The system now processes scraped internet videos, splits them into clips using CV-based scene detection, and enables human review for final curationâ€”all using a pure virtual clip workflow.

**Original Challenge**: The legacy system encoded clips during scene detection, making review operations expensive due to re-encoding. Sprite generation for navigation added complexity and storage overhead.

**Solution Approach**: Transition to "virtual clips"â€”database records with cut points, no physical files until final export. This enables instant review operations, eliminates intermediate file generation, and provides a clean, maintainable foundation.

**Major Work Completed:**
- âœ… **Legacy Code Removal**: All legacy merge/split/splice/sprite code and files fully removed. See "Legacy Code Removal Plan (Historical)" below.
- âœ… **Enhanced VirtualClips Module**: Refactored into focused modules:
  - `virtual_clips/` (core creation/management)
  - `virtual_clips/cut_point_operations.ex` (add/remove/move cut point operations)
  - `virtual_clips/mece_validation.ex` (MECE validation)
  - `virtual_clips/cut_point_operation.ex` (audit trail schema)
- âœ… **Artifacts/Shared Organization**: Artifact utilities moved to `artifacts/operations.ex`. Shared error handling in `shared/error_handling.ex`.
- âœ… **Centralized FFmpeg Configuration**: Declarative encoding profiles eliminating hardcoded settings across Python/Elixir with consistent `master`, `proxy`, and optimized export strategy.
- âœ… **Organizational Cleanup**: Directory structure flattened, all module references updated, deprecated code (~85 lines) removed.
- âœ… **CloudFront Streaming**: Complete replacement of WebCodecs/MSE/nginx-mp4 with native CloudFront byte-range streaming via standard HTML5 video for maximum simplicity and reliability.
- ðŸŽ‰ **Current State**: Production-ready CloudFront streaming architecture with clean, maintainable foundation.

**Architecture Foundation**: All cut point operations now maintain MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) properties through algorithmic validation, ensuring no gaps, overlaps, or coverage holes in video processing.

## Key Principles

1. **Virtual-First**: All clips start as virtual cut points, only materialized when exported
2. **MECE Guarantee**: Cut points across source videos are mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive  
3. **Rolling Export**: Individual clip export rather than batch processing
4. **Clean Abstractions**: No legacy merge/split/splice/sprite concepts, centralized FFmpeg configuration
5. **CloudFront Streaming**: Native HTML5 video with CloudFront byte-range support for maximum simplicity

## Core Architecture

### Virtual Clip Lifecycle

```
Source Video: new â†’ download â†’ preprocess â†’ detect_scenes â†’ virtual clips created
                                    â†“
Virtual Clips: pending_review â†’ review_approved â†’ exported (physical) â†’ keyframed â†’ embedded
                    â†“                â†“                â†“
              review_skipped    cut_adjustments   keyframe_failed
                    â†“           (instant DB ops)        â†“
             (terminal)              â†“          (resumable)
                              pending_review
```

## Enhanced Virtual Clips Operations

### Core Functions

```elixir
# Enhanced VirtualClips module (delegates to focused modules)
defmodule Heaters.Clips.VirtualClips do
  def create_virtual_clips_from_cut_points/3
  def update_virtual_clip_cut_points/2
  defdelegate add_cut_point(source_video_id, frame_number, user_id), to: CutPointOperations
  defdelegate remove_cut_point(source_video_id, frame_number, user_id), to: CutPointOperations
  defdelegate move_cut_point(source_video_id, old_frame, new_frame, user_id), to: CutPointOperations
  defdelegate validate_mece_for_source_video(source_video_id), to: MeceValidation
  defdelegate get_cut_points_for_source_video(source_video_id), to: MeceValidation
  defdelegate ensure_complete_coverage(source_video_id, total_duration), to: MeceValidation
end
```

## Review Workflow (Post-Legacy)

1. **Human reviews virtual clips and takes actions:**
   - **approve** â†’ `review_approved` (ready for export)
   - **skip** â†’ `review_skipped` (terminal state)
   - **archive** â†’ `review_archived` (cleanup via archive worker)
   - **group** â†’ group clips for review/metadata purposes
   - **add/remove/move cut point** â†’ instant cut point operations via `VirtualClips.CutPointOperations` â†’ new virtual clips with full audit trail
2. **Actions execute immediately with database transactions, no file re-encoding**
3. **Undo:** Only a simple UI-level undo (e.g., Control+Z) for the most recent action is supported. No buffer/Oban undo or multi-step undo remains.

### âœ… Infrastructure Enhancement: Centralized FFmpeg Configuration (COMPLETE)
- Declarative encoding profiles (`Infrastructure.Orchestration.FFmpegConfig`) for all video operations
- Eliminated hardcoded FFmpeg settings across Python tasks and Elixir modules
- Semantic profiles: `master` (Glacier archival), `proxy` (dual-purpose review/export), `download_normalization`, `keyframe_extraction`, `single_frame`
- Maintained "I/O at the edges" architecture with Python receiving pre-built arguments

### âœ… Storage Strategy Optimization (COMPLETE)
**Decision**: Export from proxy instead of master for superior quality and performance.

**Quality & Performance Benefits:**
- **Higher Quality**: Proxy CRF 20 > deprecated final_export CRF 23
- **10x Faster**: Stream copy vs re-encoding eliminates transcoding time
- **Zero Quality Loss**: No generational loss or transcoding artifacts
- **Instant Access**: Proxy in S3 Standard vs master in S3 Glacier (1-12hr retrieval)

**Cost Optimization:**
- **95% Storage Savings**: Master moved to S3 Glacier for archival only
- **Dual-Purpose Proxy**: Single file serves both WebCodecs review and export needs
- **Streaming Ready**: CRF 20 all-I-frame perfect for Cloudflare Stream ingestion

**Implementation:**
- Updated `py/tasks/export_clips.py` to use proxy with FFmpeg stream copy and S3 presigned URLs
- Updated `lib/heaters/clips/export/worker.ex` to pass proxy_path instead of master_path

**I/O Optimization Strategy:**
- **Direct S3 Access**: FFmpeg reads proxy via presigned URLs (no full download)
- **Byte-Range Seeking**: Leverages HTTP range requests for efficient seeking
- **:moov Atom Optimization**: Proxy files use `faststart` for instant seeking capability

- **CloudFront Optimization**: Automatic byte-range caching and global edge distribution
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works across all modern browsers without feature detection
- **Zero Maintenance**: No custom streaming services to maintain or debug

**Architecture Flow:**
```
Virtual Clip â†’ VideoUrlHelper.get_video_url() â†’ CloudFront URL (proxy file)
             â†“
Phoenix LiveView â†’ CloudFrontVideoPlayer hook â†’ HTML5 <video> with timing constraints
             â†“
CloudFront CDN â†’ S3 byte-range requests â†’ Native streaming playback
```

**Ready for Production**: CloudFront's native byte-range support handles all streaming complexity. Virtual clips play with timing constraints enforced in JavaScript.

**Production Considerations for I/O Optimization:**
- **S3 Presigned URL Security**: 1-hour expiration prevents URL leakage while allowing sufficient export time
- **CloudFront Integration**: Consider CloudFront presigned URLs for improved global performance
- **Error Handling**: Fallback to local download if presigned URL access fails (network issues, expired URLs)
- **Monitoring**: Track byte-range request patterns and proxy file access frequency
- **Cost Impact**: Reduced egress costs due to targeted byte-range access vs full file downloads
