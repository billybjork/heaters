# Native Elixir Scene Detection - Production Readiness

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE  
**Next Session:** Production hardening and optimization

## Implementation Complete ✅

Native Elixir scene detection using Evision (OpenCV bindings) has been successfully implemented and tested. The system now uses hybrid processing: native Elixir for scene detection, Python for ML/media processing.

## Remaining Production Readiness Items

### 1. Performance Optimization & Monitoring
- **Memory usage profiling** - Monitor Evision memory consumption during large video processing
- **Processing time benchmarks** - Compare native vs Python performance on production video sizes
- **Resource limits** - Set appropriate memory/time limits for SpliceWorker
- **Metrics collection** - Add timing and success rate metrics for scene detection

### 2. Error Handling & Resilience
- **NIF crash recovery** - Ensure proper supervisor strategies for Evision operations
- **Memory leak detection** - Monitor for OpenCV resource cleanup issues
- **Graceful degradation** - Fallback strategies if Evision fails in production
- **Error categorization** - Distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable failures

### 3. Production Testing
- **Load testing** - Process multiple videos concurrently to test resource usage
- **Edge case validation** - Test with various video formats, sizes, and corruption scenarios
- **S3 idempotency verification** - Confirm clip existence checking works under load
- **Integration testing** - End-to-end workflow with real S3 and database

### 4. Operational Considerations
- **Logging improvements** - Enhanced structured logging for debugging scene detection issues
- **Alerting setup** - Monitor for scene detection failures and performance degradation
- **Rollback procedures** - Document how to quickly disable native implementation if needed
- **Documentation updates** - Update operational runbooks with new architecture

### 5. Optional Enhancements
- **GPU acceleration** - Explore CUDA support in Evision for faster processing
- **Adaptive thresholds** - Dynamic scene detection parameters based on video content
- **Batch processing** - Process multiple clips concurrently within same worker
- **Caching strategies** - Cache video metadata to avoid repeated extraction

## Success Criteria for Production

- [ ] Scene detection success rate > 99% on production videos
- [ ] Memory usage stays within acceptable limits (< 2GB per worker)
- [ ] Processing time comparable to or better than Python implementation
- [ ] Zero NIF crashes in production environment
- [ ] S3 idempotency prevents duplicate clip processing
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting properly configured

## Next Session Focus

1. **Performance profiling** - Measure and optimize memory/CPU usage
2. **Production testing** - Load test with real video data
3. **Monitoring setup** - Configure metrics and alerting
4. **Documentation** - Update operational procedures
